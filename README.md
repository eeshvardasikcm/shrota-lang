# shrota-lang
shrota-lang is a new language created on February, 25 2022. Shrota language is based on the newest releses of rust language. There are some small differences to rust that follow the coding principles that Eeshvar Das (Erik Douglas Ward) is putting forth.
## Small differences from rust language
Shrota language does not use the "let" keyword ambiguously. The English language allows the word "let" to be used in any form of speech or writing.

In Shrota language "let" is removed and replaced with "que", as in 'queue' memory allocation pending 'query' for permissions to allocate.

que s: String = "characters allocation".

The double colon ("::") operator is not supported and is replaced with the lambda "->" symbol when at least one a-Z char surrounding it.

(Nadi::Yoga) becomes (Nadi->Yoga)

Please excuse the faulty syntax and grammar for now. I will be downloading the rust toolkit and NDK for Android Studio next month and everything should clean up.
## Developed for ARM(Android 12+) and x86-64(Windows 10+, Debian)
RenderScript has become depricated as of Android 12. The creator of shrota-lang, Eeshvar Das (Erik Douglas Ward) currently only has access to develop shrota-lang using only a x86-64, ARM, Android 12+ and Windows 10+ environment. Hopefully in 2013, I will start making binaries on Debian.
## Ethics principles
shrota-lang may only be used in an ethical manner. shrota-lang may not be used for warfare or in any way that damages others.
## Shrota language is a proprietary language
At this time, GitHub sponsorship paid directly to this eeshvardasikcm GitHub repository is the only way to ethically acquire permissions to use shrota-lang. My GitHub Sponsorship Accont is pending.
## shrota-lang is currently under development and has no stable or beta release
Earliest expected release of beta is mid March as I have to pay for bandpass to download the necessary dependencies.

This software license is for one person only. The GitHub Sponsor program has both a monthly and a one time sponsor option. Monthly sponsors can use the software they gained access to for lifetime for only the one person that sponsors Erik Douglas Ward (Eeshvar Das, eeshvardasikcm) on GitHub. Although this is a lifetime license through GitHub sponsorship given to one person, the GitHub monthly sponsorship only permits access to updates if the monthly sponsorship is maintained. Cancelling a monthly sponsorship means that access to the private repositories are lost. Cancellation means the code that was used or downloaded during monthly sponsorship access to private reposiroties is the most recent version of the private repositories that the sponsor is permitted to use for the rest of their lifetime unless they resubscribe later and again gain access to the updates in the private repositories on GitHub eeshvardasikcm.
The One-time sponsor towards sponsorware opens the sponsorware to that one person for life and leads toward opening the associated sponsorware repository to open source.
