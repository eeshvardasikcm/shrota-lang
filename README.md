# shrota-lang
shrota-lang is a new language created on February, 25 2022. Shrota language is based on the newest releses of rust language. There are some small differences to rust that follow the coding principles that Eeshvar Das (Erik Douglas Ward) is putting forth.
## Small differences from rust language
Shrota language does not use the "let" keyword ambiguously. The English language allows the word "let" to be used in any form of speech or writing.

In Shrota language "let" is removed and replaced with "que", as in 'queue' memory allocation pending 'query' for permissions to allocate.

que s: String = "characters allocation".

The double colon ("::") operator is not supported and is replaced with the lambda "->" symbol when at least one a-Z char surrounding it.

(Nadi::Yoga) becomes (Nadi->Yoga)

Please excuse the faulty syntax and grammar for now. I will be downloading the rust toolkit and NDK for Android Studio next month and everything should clean up.
## Developed for ARM(Android 12+) and x86-64(Windows 10+, Debian)
RenderScript has become depricated as of Android 12. The creator of shrota-lang, Eeshvar Das (Erik Douglas Ward) currently only has access to develop shrota-lang using only a x86-64, ARM, Android 12+ and Windows 10+ environment. Hopefully in 2013, I will start making binaries on Debian.
## Ethics principles
shrota-lang may only be used in an ethical manner. shrota-lang may not be used for warfare or in any way that damages others.
## Shrota language is a proprietary language
At this time, GitHub sponsorship paid directly to this eeshvardasikcm GitHub repository is the only way to ethically acquire permissions to use shrota-lang. My GitHub Sponsorship Accont is pending.
## shrota-lang is currently under development and has no stable or beta release
Earliest expected release of beta is mid March as I have to pay for bandpass to download the necessary dependencies.
