# shrota-lang
shrota-lang is a new language created on February, 25 2022. Shrota language is based on the newest releses of rust language. There are some small differences to rust that follow the coding principles that Eeshvar Das (Erik Douglas Ward) is putting forth.
## Small differences from rust language
Shrota language does not use the "let" keyword ambiguously. The English language allows the word "let" to be used in any form of speech or writing.
In Shrota language "let" is removed and replaced with "req", meeaning "request for allocation permissions and then allocate if permitted".
The colon (":") and the double colon ("::") operators are respectively replaced with the keyword "strict_typed" and the lambda syntax.
## Developed for x86-64 and ARM on Android 12+ and Windows 10+
RenderScript has become depricated as of Android 12. The creator of shrota-lang, Eeshvar Das (Erik Douglas Ward) currently only has access to develop shrota-lang using only a x86-64, ARM, Android 12+ and Windows 10+ environment.
## Ethics principles
shrota-lang may only be used in an ethical manner. shrota-lang may not be used for warfare or in any way that damages others.
